  <abstract>"Under under a scenario that includes current measures  and the contribution from LULUCF, absolute emissions are projected to &#13;
be 727 Mt in 2020, 1.2% below 2005 levels. Emissions from the oil and gas and buildings sectors are expected to increase, while &#13;
emissions in the electricity sector are projected to decrease between 2005 and 2020. Emissions in the transportation, emissions&#13;
-intensive and trade-exposed, agriculture, and waste and other sectors remain close to 2005 levels."  (LULUCF = Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry).</abstract>
