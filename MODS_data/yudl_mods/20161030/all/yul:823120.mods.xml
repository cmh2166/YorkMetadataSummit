  <abstract>The authors advocate a green social contract:  "A &#8220;green social contract&#8221; would guide a government to prioritize both the environment and the well-being of its citizens in any decision-making process, and would include strategies for helping workers transition to green jobs and protect against widespread unemployment. &#8220;Just transition&#8221; packages should include education and training, income support and mobility allowances for workers who need assistance in changing careers. A coordinated strategy should bring in secondary, post-secondary and training/apprenticeship programs to ensure appropriate skills development."</abstract>
