  <abstract>BlueGreen Canada calls on the Ontario government to cut energy use by 25 per cent by 2025 (&#8220;25 by 25.&#8221;) According to the economic analysis commissioned by BlueGreen and conducted by Stokes Economic Consulting, reducing consumption by 25% would result in 25,000 new jobs, $3.7 billion more in GDP, lower deficits for both the federal and provincial governments, and a 9% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025. BlueGreen Canada states that a more aggressive conservation approach is supported by environmental groups. &#13;
&#13;
The release of the BlueGreen report coincides with a formal review of the provincial government&#8217;s long term energy plan.</abstract>
