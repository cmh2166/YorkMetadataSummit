  <abstract>The author characterizes the upcoming 2016 "Breakfree" protests as part of  a &#8220;climate insurgency&#8221;, which is seen &#8220;not only as a moral but as a legal right and duty, necessary to protect the Constitution and the public trust for ourselves and our posterity&#8221;. Brecher catalogues other U.S. examples, including the court challenges led by  Our Children&#8217;s Trust.</abstract>
