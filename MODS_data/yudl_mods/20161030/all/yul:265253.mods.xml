  <abstract>Image of a group of houses and buildings on a street. A wall of one of the buildings features a nationalist/republican mural with a chained hand holding a flower over a map of Ireland, heraldic shields, and a "Free Ireland" slogan. Another building features a mural that says "The fools the fools they have left us our Fenian dead and while Ireland holds these graves Ireland unfree shall never be at peace." A car, part of a truck, and a woman walking are also visible.</abstract>
