  <abstract>Achieving Balance was released on December 2, 2013. It is an updated long-term energy plan which emphasizes energy conservation, maintains the policy of ending coal-generated electricity, and holds the line on investment in new nuclear power facilities.  The Thunder Bay nuclear plant will be converted to generate energy from advanced biomass.  The plan acknowledges Ontario&#8217;s reduced energy demands and sets a target of about half of Ontario&#8217;s installed generating capacity to come from renewable sources by 2025. Several backgrounders were also released supporting the strategic directions, including backgrounders re Northern Ontario, First Nations, and conservation. Also available in French.</abstract>
