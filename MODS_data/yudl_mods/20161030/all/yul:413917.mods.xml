  <abstract>Report submitted to the NRTEE by the Canadian Urban Institute on the sustainability of building practices. The report sets out to define sustainable buildings practice and identifies the benefits of focusing on this area of endeavor. The report briefly describes the concept of a supply chain and why this concept is a useful way to view the activities related to implementing a sustainable buildings program. Sustainable buildings (also referred to as green, resource-efficiency and high-performance buildings) rely on an integrated approach to design, procurement, construction and building operations. The application of sustainable building practices can reduce or minimize the on-going impact of an individual building both on the environment and in terms of operating costs. Such practices can also have benefits for the community as a whole through promoting of conservation, minimizing waste and reducing air pollution. The concept is relatively new and as such is not yet widely known.</abstract>
