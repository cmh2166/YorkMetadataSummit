  <abstract>This report summarizes and analyzes a series of four workshops held in February and March of 2011. The workshops were held in Penticton (BC), Edmonton (AB), Sydney (NS), and Sherbrooke (QC), with the aim of obtaining governmental and stakeholder input on the topic of collaborative water governance, particularly as it relates to the natural resource sectors and ongoing water policy change at the provincial scale.</abstract>
