  <abstract>In April 2003, the National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) launched Phase II of its Ecological Fiscal Reform (EFR) program. The objective of Phase II is to &#8220;develop and promote fiscal policy that consistently and systematically reduces energy-based carbon emissions in Canada, both in absolute terms and as a ratio of GDP, without increasing other pollutants&#8221;. This report provides a qualitative analysis the possible macroeconomic impacts of fiscal policies arising out of three case studies prepared for the NRTEE seeking to promote long-term &#8220;decarbonisation&#8221; through increased use of hydrogen, energy efficiency and renewable power. The findings of this study will be incorporated into the NRTEE&#8217;s final State of the Debate report.</abstract>
