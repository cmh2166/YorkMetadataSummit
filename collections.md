#### Allan Robb Fleming : yul-f0529

 - **description:** Allan Robb Fleming was born in Toronto on 7 May 1929 to immigrant Scottish parents, Isabella Osborne Fleming and Allan Stevenson Fleming. His mother was a nurse and teacher; his father a switchman and later a clerk for Canadian National Railways. He studied commercial art at the Western Technical School until 1945, and was hired as an illustrator immediately on graduation into the mail order catalogue illustration department of T. Eaton Company. During this time he met Nancy Barbara Chisholm, whom he was married in 1951. After leaving Eaton's in 1947, Fleming worked as a layout artist with the Art Associates Studio and later as the art director of the advertising firm Aiken McCracken. He joined another advertising firm, Art and Design Service, in 1951, and worked with clients such as Ford, Helena Rubinstein, and Kaiser-Frazer until April 1953. Fleming started his own freelance practice at this time, beginning a relationship with Steve Barootes that included the design of print material and signage for Barootes' restaurant, The Fifth Avenue. He also attended a series of Typography Workshops at Cooper & Beatty Typesetters run by Carl Dair. This instruction formalised Fleming's fascination with the letterform, and he resolved to travel to Europe and England to study with master typographers and book designers. Allan and Nancy Fleming left for England in April 1953, where Allan worked as an art director for the advertising firm John Tait and Partners. He studied in London at the St Bride Printing Library, the British Library incunabula collection and the Victoria and Albert Museum National Art Library, as well as frequenting the most important typographers and type historians of the day. He was mentored by Beatrice Warde of the Monotype Corporation, Oliver Simon, Stanley Morison and others, and began to collect what would become a comprehensive reference library of books about typography, design, and book design. In London, Allan and Nancy met their lifelong friends, the poet Richard Outram and his wife to be, the artist Barbara Howard. On their return from London to Toronto in 1955, Fleming began working informally with Cooper & Beatty as a freelance designer and became head of the Typography Department of the Ontario College of Art, where until 1961 his teaching influenced a significant number of well-known graphic and editorial designers who emerged in the 1970s. In 1957 he was appointed Creative Director of Cooper & Beatty and his design and art direction work there during the following six years, informed by the study and mentoring he had followed in London, was of such a high calibre and so prolific that it was awarded numerous awards from professional associations such as the Toronto, Montreal and New York Art Directors' Clubs, Type Director's Club of New York, American Institute of Graphic Arts, the Aspen and Silvermine Design Conferences, and the Advertising Typographers' Association of New York. Fleming was well known in the United States as a Canadian graphic designer, and respected as a peer. During his time at Cooper & Beatty, he also organised a series of landmark exhibitions of international typographic designers. From 1963 to 1968 Fleming was Creative Director of the influential MacLaren Advertising firm while maintaining a busy freelance practice. Fleming's most significant contributions were to national identity and to the visual culture of Canada in the formative period of the 1960s. His logo design for Canadian National Railway was commissioned in 1959 and launched in 1960; it is still used today. Other logo designs for government and for important Canadian institutions in this formative period for the country are: Trent University (1964), Ontario Hydro (1965), National Design Council of the Department of Industry (1965), Toronto Symphony Orchestra (1965), Hudson's Bay Company (1969), ETVO (now TVOntario, 1970), Gray Coach Lines (1971) and others. Later, in 1973-74, while working with Burton Kramer Associates, he was involved in developing the project that led to rebranding the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He worked on a number of important centennial projects during the mid 1960s, notably the award-winning book Canada: A Year of the Land for the National Film Board Still Photography Division. He was a jury member for the award of the design of Canada's centennial coinage, and worked closely with the competition's winner, Alex Colville, to create typographic elements for the commemorative coins. He designed the logo for Ontario's centennial project, the Ontario Science Centre, and a number of its early publications. He participated in the international design conference that took place at Expo '67, and was awarded the Centennial Medal by the government of Canada. In 1965, he was also awarded the Medal of the Royal Canadian Academy for "his distinguished contribution to the art of typographic design." Fleming also designed the first annual report for the Canada Council for the Arts in 1960, the street and shop signage for Upper Canada Village in 1961, lettering and silverware for Ron Thom's Massey College in 1963, a redesign of "Maclean's" magazine in 1963, electoral publications for the Liberal Party in 1965, the medal struck to commemorate the new Toronto City Hall in 1965 as well as its Hall of Memory and, for the Hudson's Bay Company anniversary celebrations in 1970, he produced a film directed by Christopher Chapman. In 1968 Fleming was commissioned by Postmaster General Eric Kierans to strike and lead a working committee on the design of Canada's postage stamps; he appointed, among others, artist Christopher Pratt and curator and arts administrator David Silcox. His "Report to the Canada Post Office on their philatelic product" became the new style guide for a renaissance in Canadian postage design that still forms the basis of stamp design in Canada. Fleming went on to art direct and design numerous stamps until his untimely demise from heart disease on 31 December 1977. He was awarded the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal just a few months before his death.

Petty attended Park Lawn Public School in Etobicoke, and the Brown School and North Toronto Collegiate in Toronto. Petty has remarked that "I got thrown out of every high school I went to, for talking. No one mentioned this could be a career move." As an adolescent, Petty worked as a model for her mother's agency working in local commercials, photo shoots and documentaries ("Who is Sylvia", 1957) under the name Diana Kerr (her mother's maiden name). She married at 18 and worked in Peterson Productions (one of Canada's first commercial studios). In 1968, Petty was approached by CKEY radio employee Tommy Vradenberg to join the company. Petty had been active in the Toronto Parachute Club as a skydiver and as a result, CKEY thought she would be a good candidate to fly the company's helicopter to report the morning weather and traffic for the city of Toronto. Petty acquired her pilot's license and became known as "The Girl in the Pink Helicopter" as the radio station developed a marketing strategy around Petty in which she dressed in pink, rode a pink helicopter and drove a pink car while on the job. Petty was a traffic reporter for CKEY for several years before giving birth to her first child, at which point she took a job at CITYTV in 1979, where she hosted a phone-in show titled "HELP", later reworked as "Sweet City Woman" which eventually developed into "City Line". She also worked as a reporter for City Pulse news along with Gord Martineau, Colin Vaughan, Peter Silverman, Anne Mroczkowski and Jojo Chintoh.

Her series "Incest: Scandal in the Family", won the silver medal in the nation-wide Can Pro Awards in 1980. In 1981 her documentary "Having A Baby" (which followed her own pregnancy and the birth of her son) won the gold medal at Can Pro, plus the "Award of Excellance", the highest award for the Can Pro festival. She was also nominated for "best TV documentary writer" in the 1981 ACTRA awards. Petty anchored CITY-TV'scurrent affairs program CityWide from May 1987 to 1989 when she left to work for CFTO-TV, which launched The Dini Petty Show. Directed by Randy Gulliver, The Dini Petty show ran from 1989 to 1999. A reflection of the popular culture at the time, the daily talk show featured interviews with actors, authors, singers and performers. The show received the NATPE (National Association of Television Program Executives) International Iris Award in 1992 for an hour-long interview with Red Skelton, as well as Gemini Awards for best host (awarded in 1992, nominated in 1997 and 1998), a Can-Pro Award in 1997 for a one hour interview with Sara Ferguson, Duchess of York. Petty's contract ended with CTV in 2000 which led to a legal case that resulted in Petty being awarded the broadcast tapes of "The Dini Petty Show". Dini Petty continued to contribute and develop documentary television as well as contributing to charitable causes such as the Coats for Kids campaign, the Pregnancy Youth Line and the Christian Children's Fund projects related to children, and as a spokesperson for Amnesty International.

#### Rita Greer Allen

 - **description:** Rita Greer Allen, writer, broadcaster and artist, was born Marguerita Foulger Wayman in Erith, Kent, England, on 25 September 1918 to parents Joshua Edwin Wayman and Margaret Tilley Potts. After moving to Canada at the age of five, Marguerita, who became known as Rita Weyman, attended East York Collegiate Institute in Toronto before enrolling in a first-year pass arts program at Trinity College, University of Toronto, in 1940. Her studies were interrupted by marriage to Robert Greer Allen, a Trinity College graduate and Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps private, on 13 June 1941. For the duration of the World War II, Rita followed Robert to Halifax, Moncton, Kingston, Montreal and Vancouver and attended the Nova Scotia College of Art, Mount Allison University, and Queens University. In collaboration with Robert, who worked for Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio during the war, Rita wrote and submitted dramatic radio scripts for broadcast with some success, with a number of scripts broadcast on Trans-Canada Network radio program "Stage 45". In the early 1950s, the Greer Allens returned to Toronto, and Rita began her prolific freelance scriptwriting career, writing and researching her own radio scripts for the CBC, the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Though many of her scripts were adapted literary dramas, Rita was equally successful as a writer for documentary-style radio programs and educational programming for high school students. Her writing for radio included scripts for documentary series "As children see us", and dramatic adaptations of "Barometer rising" and "The Duchess of Malfi". By the mid- to late-1950s, Rita turned her attention to television, appearing as a panellist on the CBC quiz show "One of a kind" in 1958 and 1959. She also wrote dramatic scripts for television, including "The Gioconda smile", "Lord Arthur Saville's crime", and "The grass harp", but the majority of her work in the 1960s and early 1970s was for CBC television current events program "Take 30", for which she conducted interviews, researched and wrote scripts, and presented her work on-screen. In the 1970s, Rita continued to write dramatic scripts, finding success in 1976 with her original CBC television drama "The raku fire", which was directed by Rita's brother, Ronald Weyman, a successful screenwriter and director in his own right. In the late 1970s, Rita focused her attention on developing her artistic skills, particularly the practice of raku pottery, and exhibited her sculptural nudes in the early-to-mid 1980s. Her study of Jungian psychology during this period led to a collaboration with Jungian Marion Woodman, with whom she wrote "Leaving my father's house: a journey to conscious femininity" (1993). Rita Greer Allen died in Toronto on 30 May 2010.

#### Robert Greer Allen

 - **description:** obert Greer Allen, a writer, producer and director of radio and television drama, was born in Toronto on 19 October 1917 to Arthur Greer Allen and Eleanor Beatrice Higginbottom. He attended University of Toronto Schools between September 1932 and June 1935 and served as editor of the school journal, "The phoenix". In September 1935, Robert began his studies at Trinity College, University of Toronto, where he was an editor of the "Trinity University review", president of the Trinity College Dramatic Society, and a features editor of "The varsity". He graduated with an honours BA in political science and economy in 1939. Allen's interest in writing, specifically short stories and radio plays, flourished through his marriage to Rita Weyman in 1941. Together, Robert and Rita wrote and submitted many radio scripts for broadcast during the 1940s. In 1941, Robert enlisted as a private in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps and was later promoted to the ranks of sergeant, staff sergeant, warrant officer, lieutenant, and lieutenant colonel. His radio production career began in earnest during the war when he was seconded to the Communications Corps and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) to write and produce a radio program for the Dominion Network titled "Servicemen's forum", for which he travelled throughout Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Holland, Germany and Denmark. After the war, Robert continued his work for the CBC, becoming a producer for a variety of radio programs, including the CBC's international service, the CBC Radio Orchestra, and music and drama for CBC radio in Vancouver, between 1947 and 1952. Robert's success as a radio producer made him a desirable choice to help launch CBC television in 1952, and the Greer Allens returned to Toronto from Vancouver. As a producer, supervising producer, assistant program director, program director and supervising producer in television drama and special programs, Robert was integral to the production of much CBC original dramatic programming in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Credited as Robert Allen, he worked as supervising or executive producer for programs including "Sunshine sketches" (1952-1953), "Playbill" (1953-1964), "General Motors theatre" (1954-1956), "Folio" (1955-1959), "Ford startime" (1959-1960), "Festival" (1960-1969), "Opening night"(1974-1975), "Performance" (1974-1976), "The great detective" (1979-1982), "Seeing things" (1981-1987), and "The way we are" (1985-1988), and became the executive producer of CBC Drama. After more than 40 years of work for the CBC, he retired in 1990. Robert Greer Allen died in Toronto on 20 August 2005.

#### Sheldon and Judy Godfrey collection

 - **description:** Sheldon (1938-) and Judy (1940-) Godfrey were born in Toronto. Sheldon Godfrey received a Master of Arts in Canadian history from the University of Rochester in 1962, a Doctor Juris from the University of Toronto 1964 and was called to the bar in 1966. Judy Godfrey practiced as an occupational therapist since 1961, and she pioneered the diagnosis and treatment of perceptual handicaps in children. In addition to several philanthropic, environmental and civic initiatives that began in the early 1970s, the Godfreys have been leaders in the preservation of Ontario's built heritage, and as prolific researchers and writers on the Jewish experience in pre-Confederation Canada. They have undertaken the restoration of commercial heritage buildings in Ontario, focussing on Toronto since 1975, leading to several national and local awards in the early 1980s. They were founders of the Town of York Historical Society in 1983, have been active in other community-based heritage organizations, and have played a leading role in strengthening government policies for heritage preservation. During the 1990s, the Godfreys, with Sheldon serving as Chairman of The Heritage Canada Foundation, led an effort to redefine the popular understanding of heritage to include intangible subjects as well as historic buildings, taking an inclusive approach that reflected Canada's diverse multicultural population. In addition to drafting new heritage mission statements for Heritage Canada in 1993 and for the City of Toronto in 1999, the Godfreys have written extensively on heritage and, during the 1990s, on the Jewish experience in Canada prior to Confederation. Their research on this topic formed the basis for two books: "Burn This Gossip: The True Story of George Benjamin of Belleville, Canada's First Jewish Member of Parliament, 1856-1863" (Toronto, 1991); and "Search Out the Land: The Jews and the Growth of Equality in British Colonial America, 1740-1867" (Montreal, 1995), which won several awards as a result of its contribution to Jewish and multicultural history. Sheldon Godfrey was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1998.

#### Toronto Telegram

 - **description:** The 'Toronto telegram' (originally the 'Evening telegram,') was launched in 1876 by John Ross Robertson. The 'Tely' strongly supported the British connection in Canada, appealing to British and Imperial sentiments even after Canadian nationalism became fashionable. The newspaper was locked in a circulation war with its afternoon rival, the 'Toronto star', for much of the twentieth century. The battle involved giveaway contests, scoops, and even hiding personalities (like swimmer Marilyn Bell) from the competition to ensure exclusive stories. Following Robertson's death, the paper was continued by a trust he had established. In 1948 the newspaper was sold to George McCullagh, owner of the Toronto Globe & mail, who invited John Bassett to act as publisher. In 1952 Bassett bought the newspaper and attempted to best the Star with new features in his newspaper, the introduction of colour photography (which meant the demise of the famous 'pink' newsprint on which the "Tely" had been printed), and other modernizations (including a news office building). Falling circulation and lack of advertising led Bassett to close the newspaper in 1971.

#### York University historical collection

 - **description:** The York University historical collection is an assembly of documents in a number of formats accumulated by York University Archives to document the ongoing history of the university. The early part of the collection is made up of material acquired from the Stong Historical Society and from John Becker who joined the staff of York University in 1966 as assistant to the dean of Atkinson College. Becker later served as assistant vice president (Student affairs) and assistant vice-president (business operations). The collection has since expanded to include other sources such as artwork, oral histories and audio-visual recordings of special events. Much of the material received from the Stong Historical Society concerns the history of the land and community on which the main campus of the university is located in Toronto (formerly North York) Ontario. The original community, Kaiserville (later Elia), established circa 1800, was home to German loyalist settlers who had left Pennsylvania following the American Revolutionary War. The first settler in the area was Peter Erlin Kaiser who is buried on what is now the grounds of York University. When the University purchased its Keele Street land, there were extant buildings on the site. Among these, the principal buildings were the Jacob Stong house and the Abraham Hoover house. The Stong house was built on a parcel of land sold to Jacob by his father Daniel (d. 1868) and was constructed in the 1850s. Descendants of Jacob Stong sold the house in 1951. The Stong lands now form the central part of Black Creek Pioneer Village as well as forming the northern portion of the University property. The Hoover residence, built on a plot purchased by Christian Hoover in 1826, was constructed in 1848 by Christian and his son Abraham (1821-1905). The land (buildings and farm) was held by the Hoover family until the 1930s when it was purchased by a Mrs. Hart. In 1958 the house was purchased by Claude Passy, who resided in it for a period of time before selling it to York University ca. 1964. The Stong Historical Society was established in 1979 at Stong College, York University. Its purpose was to discover the history of the area on which the university was built, and it proposed that the houses of the Stong College residence bear the names of the pioneer families of the area. The society was begun by Olga Cirak, the college's administrative assistant. It is currently inactive. The collection consists of correspondence, photographs, genealogical charts, family histories, newspaper clippings, publications and related material detailing the history of the site on which the Keele Street campus of York University now stands; correspondence and newspaper clippings relating to the search for the grave site of Peter Erlin Kaiser and a photocopy of his Last Will and Testament; a genealogy and a history of the Kaiser family of Ontario (1933); copies of articles on the Palatine settlements in York County and Upper Canada; a publication, 'An account of the Boynton family and the family seat of Burton Agnes,' (1914); material on the Smith family (Hoover relations), correspondence seeking information from descendants of the Hoover family with responses, Hoover genealogies and material on the Troyer family genealogy (Hoover descendants); biographical material on York pioneers, correspondence, archaeological reports, copies of campus and survey maps and of architectural renderings of the Hart, Hoover, and Stong buildings on the University campus; obituary notices for the last surviving member of the Stong family who lived on the property, a copy of a genealogy of the family and a photocopy of a history of the church that was located on the property (by T.E. Kaiser);a newspaper article concerning Hart House, a building on the York campus which was relocated there in the 1930s from King Township, material related to the 40th anniversary celebrations of York University in 1999 and the York University Faculty Association strike of 1997, as well as other material details of which are available in the finding aid.

### yul_F0529 : Allan Robb Fleming

 - **title:** Allan Robb Fleming
 - **description:** Allan Robb Fleming was born in Toronto on 7 May 1929 to immigrant Scottish parents, Isabella Osborne Fleming and Allan Stevenson Fleming. His mother was a nurse and teacher; his father a switchman and later a clerk for Canadian National Railways. He studied commercial art at the Western Technical School until 1945, and was hired as an illustrator immediately on graduation into the mail order catalogue illustration department of T. Eaton Company. During this time he met Nancy Barbara Chisholm, whom he was married in 1951. After leaving Eaton's in 1947, Fleming worked as a layout artist with the Art Associates Studio and later as the art director of the advertising firm Aiken McCracken. He joined another advertising firm, Art and Design Service, in 1951, and worked with clients such as Ford, Helena Rubinstein, and Kaiser-Frazer until April 1953. Fleming started his own freelance practice at this time, beginning a relationship with Steve Barootes that included the design of print material and signage for Barootes' restaurant, The Fifth Avenue. He also attended a series of Typography Workshops at Cooper & Beatty Typesetters run by Carl Dair. This instruction formalised Fleming's fascination with the letterform, and he resolved to travel to Europe and England to study with master typographers and book designers. Allan and Nancy Fleming left for England in April 1953, where Allan worked as an art director for the advertising firm John Tait and Partners. He studied in London at the St Bride Printing Library, the British Library incunabula collection and the Victoria and Albert Museum National Art Library, as well as frequenting the most important typographers and type historians of the day. He was mentored by Beatrice Warde of the Monotype Corporation, Oliver Simon, Stanley Morison and others, and began to collect what would become a comprehensive reference library of books about typography, design, and book design. In London, Allan and Nancy met their lifelong friends, the poet Richard Outram and his wife to be, the artist Barbara Howard. On their return from London to Toronto in 1955, Fleming began working informally with Cooper & Beatty as a freelance designer and became head of the Typography Department of the Ontario College of Art, where until 1961 his teaching influenced a significant number of well-known graphic and editorial designers who emerged in the 1970s. In 1957 he was appointed Creative Director of Cooper & Beatty and his design and art direction work there during the following six years, informed by the study and mentoring he had followed in London, was of such a high calibre and so prolific that it was awarded numerous awards from professional associations such as the Toronto, Montreal and New York Art Directors' Clubs, Type Director's Club of New York, American Institute of Graphic Arts, the Aspen and Silvermine Design Conferences, and the Advertising Typographers' Association of New York. Fleming was well known in the United States as a Canadian graphic designer, and respected as a peer. During his time at Cooper & Beatty, he also organised a series of landmark exhibitions of international typographic designers. From 1963 to 1968 Fleming was Creative Director of the influential MacLaren Advertising firm while maintaining a busy freelance practice. Fleming's most significant contributions were to national identity and to the visual culture of Canada in the formative period of the 1960s. His logo design for Canadian National Railway was commissioned in 1959 and launched in 1960; it is still used today. Other logo designs for government and for important Canadian institutions in this formative period for the country are: Trent University (1964), Ontario Hydro (1965), National Design Council of the Department of Industry (1965), Toronto Symphony Orchestra (1965), Hudson's Bay Company (1969), ETVO (now TVOntario, 1970), Gray Coach Lines (1971) and others. Later, in 1973-74, while working with Burton Kramer Associates, he was involved in developing the project that led to rebranding the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He worked on a number of important centennial projects during the mid 1960s, notably the award-winning book Canada: A Year of the Land for the National Film Board Still Photography Division. He was a jury member for the award of the design of Canada's centennial coinage, and worked closely with the competition's winner, Alex Colville, to create typographic elements for the commemorative coins. He designed the logo for Ontario's centennial project, the Ontario Science Centre, and a number of its early publications. He participated in the international design conference that took place at Expo '67, and was awarded the Centennial Medal by the government of Canada. In 1965, he was also awarded the Medal of the Royal Canadian Academy for "his distinguished contribution to the art of typographic design." Fleming also designed the first annual report for the Canada Council for the Arts in 1960, the street and shop signage for Upper Canada Village in 1961, lettering and silverware for Ron Thom's Massey College in 1963, a redesign of "Maclean's" magazine in 1963, electoral publications for the Liberal Party in 1965, the medal struck to commemorate the new Toronto City Hall in 1965 as well as its Hall of Memory and, for the Hudson's Bay Company anniversary celebrations in 1970, he produced a film directed by Christopher Chapman. In 1968 Fleming was commissioned by Postmaster General Eric Kierans to strike and lead a working committee on the design of Canada's postage stamps; he appointed, among others, artist Christopher Pratt and curator and arts administrator David Silcox. His "Report to the Canada Post Office on their philatelic product" became the new style guide for a renaissance in Canadian postage design that still forms the basis of stamp design in Canada. Fleming went on to art direct and design numerous stamps until his untimely demise from heart disease on 31 December 1977. He was awarded the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal just a few months before his death.

### yul_F0575 : Dini Petty fonds

 - **title:** Dini Petty fonds
 - **description:** Dini Petty (b. 18 February 1945) is a Canadian broadcaster, television personality and talk show host. Born in England, her family emigrated to Canada when she was four months old. In her early childhood Petty moved with her parents and two siblings to various cities in Canada and the United States, including the Rockcliffe neighbourhood in Ottawa, Ontario, Galt, Ontario, Baltimore, Maryland, and Danbury Connecticut, until settling in Toronto at the age of eleven where Dini Petty's mother Molly started a modeling agency with Sylvia Train , Producers' Services and her father Gord opened one of the country's first animation houses, Film Technique. Petty attended Park Lawn Public School in Etobicoke, and the Brown School and North Toronto Collegiate in Toronto. Petty has remarked that "I got thrown out of every high school I went to, for talking. No one mentioned this could be a career move." As an adolescent, Petty worked as a model for her mother's agency working in local commercials, photo shoots and documentaries ("Who is Sylvia", 1957) under the name Diana Kerr (her mother's maiden name). She married at 18 and worked in Peterson Productions (one of Canada's first commercial studios). In 1968, Petty was approached by CKEY radio employee Tommy Vradenberg to join the company. Petty had been active in the Toronto Parachute Club as a skydiver and as a result, CKEY thought she would be a good candidate to fly the company's helicopter to report the morning weather and traffic for the city of Toronto. Petty acquired her pilot's license and became known as "The Girl in the Pink Helicopter" as the radio station developed a marketing strategy around Petty in which she dressed in pink, rode a pink helicopter and drove a pink car while on the job. Petty was a traffic reporter for CKEY for several years before giving birth to her first child, at which point she took a job at CITYTV in 1979, where she hosted a phone-in show titled "HELP", later reworked as "Sweet City Woman" which eventually developed into "City Line". She also worked as a reporter for City Pulse news along with Gord Martineau, Colin Vaughan, Peter Silverman, Anne Mroczkowski and Jojo Chintoh. Dini has received the Jaycees nomination for "Outstanding Canadian." She was one of three finalists in the 1980 ACTRA awards for "best TV Documentary Writer". Her series "Incest: Scandal in the Family", won the silver medal in the nation-wide Can Pro Awards in 1980. In 1981 her documentary "Having A Baby" (which followed her own pregnancy and the birth of her son) won the gold medal at Can Pro, plus the "Award of Excellance", the highest award for the Can Pro festival. She was also nominated for "best TV documentary writer" in the 1981 ACTRA awards. Petty anchored CITY-TV'scurrent affairs program CityWide from May 1987 to 1989 when she left to work for CFTO-TV, which launched The Dini Petty Show. Directed by Randy Gulliver, The Dini Petty show ran from 1989 to 1999. A reflection of the popular culture at the time, the daily talk show featured interviews with actors, authors, singers and performers. The show received the NATPE (National Association of Television Program Executives) International Iris Award in 1992 for an hour-long interview with Red Skelton, as well as Gemini Awards for best host (awarded in 1992, nominated in 1997 and 1998), a Can-Pro Award in 1997 for a one hour interview with Sara Ferguson, Duchess of York. Petty's contract ended with CTV in 2000 which led to a legal case that resulted in Petty being awarded the broadcast tapes of "The Dini Petty Show". Dini Petty continued to contribute and develop documentary television as well as contributing to charitable causes such as the Coats for Kids campaign, the Pregnancy Youth Line and the Christian Children's Fund projects related to children, and as a spokesperson for Amnesty International. Petty has also written a best-selling children's book "The Queen, The Bear and The Bumblebee" which has been translated into three languages and developed into a musical by The Children's Group.

 - **title:** Herbert Hunt fonds
 - **description:** Herbert William Hunt served in the artillery for the British Army during the First World War while his wife, Jessica, served in the Voluntary Aid Detachment. Hunt and his wife tried to build an agrarian life for themselves in England for six year after the war, without success. Disappointed, Hunt applied to the 3,000 Family Settlement Scheme, a joint initiative by the governments of the United Kingdom and Canada to resettle British families on farmland in central and western Canada. Canada’s Department of Immigration and Colonization accepted Hunt’s application to participate in the Settlement Scheme in March 1926. By the end of May, Hunt and his wife began their migration to their placement in St. Walburg, Saskatchewan, approximately 260 kilometres north-west of Saskatoon. After completing the probationary apprenticeship of one year, during which time new settlers were required to demonstrate their fitness by working as farm hands, Hunt purchased 160 acres of farmland from the Soldier Settlement Board. On this farm, Linden Lea, Hunt primarily cultivated wheat. Hunt and his wife struggled to acclimatize to Canada, the harsh prairie weather in particular. His crops also suffered under frost and drought. The family’s financial hardship was compounded by the low market prices of grains during the depression. After spending a challenging decade in Saskatchewan, Hunt and his wife returned to England in 1936. Hunt died in Benfleet, Essex, England in 1985.

### yul_F0520 : Knowlton Nash fonds

 - **title:** Knowlton Nash fonds
 - **description:** Cyril Knowlton Nash was born in Toronto on 18 November 1927. His involvement in journalism began as a boy, when he sold copies of the daily newspapers Toronto Star and Telegram on a street corner. He studied journalism at the University of Toronto and began his career as a freelance reporter for The Globe and Mail, covering City Hall, the police beat, sports, labour disputes, and politics. Nash joined the British United Press Service as a copy editor in 1947, and during the next three years, lived in Toronto, Halifax and Vancouver, where he became a writer and bureau chief for the wire service. He traveled extensively throughout the country, covering a wide variety of stories that included politics, economics, local news, and sports. In 1951, Nash became Director of Information for the International Federation of Agricultural Producers, a non-governmental organization that represented farm organizations in 40 countries at the United Nations. He was based in Washington, but his work took him to Paris, Rome, London, New York, Mexico City, and Nairobi. He participated in various United Nations and international committees, and organized conferences in Europe and Africa on international trade and business issues. Nash continued his involvement with print journalism by becoming Washington correspondent for the Financial Post in 1954, and also writing articles on American political and defence issues, and especially trade and commerce for the Windsor Star, Vancouver Sun, and Halifax Herald, as well as Maclean's, Chatelaine, and other Canadian periodicals. His career expanded to broadcast journalism in 1956, when he began working as a freelance correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). He was appointed Washington Correspondent in 1961, and reported on assignments from almost every part of the world that included the war in Vietnam, various Middle East crises, civil war in the Dominican Republic, political upheaval in South America, and an interview with Che Guevara in the cane fields of Cuba. Nash gained prominence for his coverage of the administrations of Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson, including the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, the Cuban missile crisis, and Kennedy's assassination. Nash also interviewed many of the world's key political leaders during this period, including Presidents of the United States and the Prime Ministers of Canada and the United Kingdom. Attracted by an opportunity to take a lead role in transforming the CBC's public affairs programming, Nash returned to Toronto in 1969 and was appointed Director of Information Programming. He was made Director of News and Current Affairs in June 1976, responsible for broadcast journalism at the national and local levels. Under his leadership, television journalism enjoyed increased resources, the national evening newscast was lengthened, and the CBC developed several series exploring the country's heritage, such as The National Dream and the broadcast memoirs of John Diefenbaker and Lester B. Pearson. Nash left his executive position in 1978, when he succeeded Peter Kent as Chief Correspondent for the CBC's English Television News, anchoring the network's National newscast and hosting the weekly series Newsmagazine as well as major television news specials. The appointment gave Nash an opportunity to return to front-line journalism, reporting on Canadian, American and British elections, the Quebec Referendum, First Ministers' conferences, summit meetings, political conventions, royal and papal visits to Canada, and the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana. Nash's connection with the viewers turned The National into a ratings success. He also led its transition to the 10:00 pm time slot in 1982, the same year that he married CBC television personality Lorraine Thomson. Nash served as Chief Correspondent until 1988, when he stepped down to prevent Peter Mansbridge from accepting a position in the United States. Nash remained with the network as senior correspondent, and anchored the weekly documentary series Witness, as well as the CBC educational series News in review from 1990 to 2004, long past his official retirement from the CBC on 28 November 1992. Nash wrote nine books about his experiences as a journalist -- History on the run : the trenchcoat memoirs of a foreign correspondent (1984), Times to remember : a Canadian photo album (1986), Prime time at ten : behind-the-camera battles of Canadian TV journalism" (1987), Kennedy and Diefenbaker : fear and loathing across the undefended border (1990), Visions of Canada : searching for our future [views on national unity] (1991), The Microphone wars : a history of triumph and betrayal at the CBC (1994), Cue the elephant! : backstage tales at the CBC (1996), Trivia pursuit : how showbiz values are corrupting the news (1998), and Swashbucklers : the story of Canada's battling broadcasters (2001). He also wrote several articles on the CBC and issues in broadcast journalism for Canadian newspapers and magazines, as well as a regular column for the Osprey Media Group. Nash has been actively involved with many educational and philanthropic organizations devoted to journalism and the advancement of literacy. He was associated with the University of Regina's School of Journalism, where he presented the inaugural James M. Minifie Memorial Lecture on the importance, standards and ethics of modern journalism on 5 October 1981, and taught in 1992-1993 as holder of the Max Bell Chair of Journalism. He was the founding chairman of the Canadian Journalism Foundation, Chairman of Word on the Street (a Canadian organization devoted to promoting the reading of books), honorary chairman of the Toronto Arts Awards Foundation, and honorary chairman of the Canadian Organization for Development Through Education (CODE), a group devoted to fostering literacy throughout the developing world. Knowlton Nash's significant contributions to Canadian broadcasting and society have been marked by many honours. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1988, and to the Order of Ontario in 1998. He was presented with the John Drainie Award by the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television, and Radio Artists in 1995, and the lifetime achievement award from the Canadian Journalism Foundation in June 2006. He also holds honorary degrees from the University of Toronto (1993), Brock University (1995), the University of Regina (1996), Loyalist College (1997), and York University (2005).

### yul_F0596 : Rita Greer Allen

 - **title:** Rita Greer Allen
 - **description:** Rita Greer Allen, writer, broadcaster and artist, was born Marguerita Foulger Wayman in Erith, Kent, England, on 25 September 1918 to parents Joshua Edwin Wayman and Margaret Tilley Potts. After moving to Canada at the age of five, Marguerita, who became known as Rita Weyman, attended East York Collegiate Institute in Toronto before enrolling in a first-year pass arts program at Trinity College, University of Toronto, in 1940. Her studies were interrupted by marriage to Robert Greer Allen, a Trinity College graduate and Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps private, on 13 June 1941. For the duration of the World War II, Rita followed Robert to Halifax, Moncton, Kingston, Montreal and Vancouver and attended the Nova Scotia College of Art, Mount Allison University, and Queens University. In collaboration with Robert, who worked for Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio during the war, Rita wrote and submitted dramatic radio scripts for broadcast with some success, with a number of scripts broadcast on Trans-Canada Network radio program "Stage 45". In the early 1950s, the Greer Allens returned to Toronto, and Rita began her prolific freelance scriptwriting career, writing and researching her own radio scripts for the CBC, the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Though many of her scripts were adapted literary dramas, Rita was equally successful as a writer for documentary-style radio programs and educational programming for high school students. Her writing for radio included scripts for documentary series "As children see us", and dramatic adaptations of "Barometer rising" and "The Duchess of Malfi". By the mid- to late-1950s, Rita turned her attention to television, appearing as a panellist on the CBC quiz show "One of a kind" in 1958 and 1959. She also wrote dramatic scripts for television, including "The Gioconda smile", "Lord Arthur Saville's crime", and "The grass harp", but the majority of her work in the 1960s and early 1970s was for CBC television current events program "Take 30", for which she conducted interviews, researched and wrote scripts, and presented her work on-screen. In the 1970s, Rita continued to write dramatic scripts, finding success in 1976 with her original CBC television drama "The raku fire", which was directed by Rita's brother, Ronald Weyman, a successful screenwriter and director in his own right. In the late 1970s, Rita focused her attention on developing her artistic skills, particularly the practice of raku pottery, and exhibited her sculptural nudes in the early-to-mid 1980s. Her study of Jungian psychology during this period led to a collaboration with Jungian Marion Woodman, with whom she wrote "Leaving my father's house: a journey to conscious femininity" (1993). Rita Greer Allen died in Toronto on 30 May 2010.

In 1941, Robert enlisted as a private in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps and was later promoted to the ranks of sergeant, staff sergeant, warrant officer, lieutenant, and lieutenant colonel.

After the war, Robert continued his work for the CBC, becoming a producer for a variety of radio programs, including the CBC's international service, the CBC Radio Orchestra, and music and drama for CBC radio in Vancouver, between 1947 and 1952. Robert's success as a radio producer made him a desirable choice to help launch CBC television in 1952, and the Greer Allens returned to Toronto from Vancouver. As a producer, supervising producer, assistant program director, program director and supervising producer in television drama and special programs, Robert was integral to the production of much CBC original dramatic programming in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

### yul_F035 : Sheldon and Judy Godfrey collection

 - **title:** Sheldon and Judy Godfrey collection
 - **description:** Sheldon (1938-) and Judy (1940-) Godfrey were born in Toronto. Sheldon Godfrey received a Master of Arts in Canadian history from the University of Rochester in 1962, a Doctor Juris from the University of Toronto 1964 and was called to the bar in 1966. Judy Godfrey practiced as an occupational therapist since 1961, and she pioneered the diagnosis and treatment of perceptual handicaps in children. In addition to several philanthropic, environmental and civic initiatives that began in the early 1970s, the Godfreys have been leaders in the preservation of Ontario's built heritage, and as prolific researchers and writers on the Jewish experience in pre-Confederation Canada. They have undertaken the restoration of commercial heritage buildings in Ontario, focussing on Toronto since 1975, leading to several national and local awards in the early 1980s. They were founders of the Town of York Historical Society in 1983, have been active in other community-based heritage organizations, and have played a leading role in strengthening government policies for heritage preservation. During the 1990s, the Godfreys, with Sheldon serving as Chairman of The Heritage Canada Foundation, led an effort to redefine the popular understanding of heritage to include intangible subjects as well as historic buildings, taking an inclusive approach that reflected Canada's diverse multicultural population. In addition to drafting new heritage mission statements for Heritage Canada in 1993 and for the City of Toronto in 1999, the Godfreys have written extensively on heritage and, during the 1990s, on the Jewish experience in Canada prior to Confederation. Their research on this topic formed the basis for two books: "Burn This Gossip: The True Story of George Benjamin of Belleville, Canada's First Jewish Member of Parliament, 1856-1863" (Toronto, 1991); and "Search Out the Land: The Jews and the Growth of Equality in British Colonial America, 1740-1867" (Montreal, 1995), which won several awards as a result of its contribution to Jewish and multicultural history. Sheldon Godfrey was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1998.

### yul_F0433 : Toronto Telegram

 - **title:** Toronto Telegram
 - **description:** The 'Toronto telegram' (originally the 'Evening telegram,') was launched in 1876 by John Ross Robertson. The 'Tely' strongly supported the British connection in Canada, appealing to British and Imperial sentiments even after Canadian nationalism became fashionable. The newspaper was locked in a circulation war with its afternoon rival, the 'Toronto star', for much of the twentieth century. The battle involved giveaway contests, scoops, and even hiding personalities (like swimmer Marilyn Bell) from the competition to ensure exclusive stories. Following Robertson's death, the paper was continued by a trust he had established. In 1948 the newspaper was sold to George McCullagh, owner of the Toronto Globe & mail, who invited John Bassett to act as publisher. In 1952 Bassett bought the newspaper and attempted to best the Star with new features in his newspaper, the introduction of colour photography (which meant the demise of the famous 'pink' newsprint on which the "Tely" had been printed), and other modernizations (including a news office building). Falling circulation and lack of advertising led Bassett to close the newspaper in 1971.

### yul_F0450 : York University historical collection

 - **title:** York University historical collection
 - **subject:** York University (Toronto, Ont.)
 - **subject:** York University (Toronto, Ont.)--York University (Toronto, Ont.)
 - **description:** The York University historical collection is an assembly of documents in a number of formats accumulated by York University Archives to document the ongoing history of the university. The early part of the collection is made up of material acquired from the Stong Historical Society and from John Becker who joined the staff of York University in 1966 as assistant to the dean of Atkinson College. Becker later served as assistant vice president (Student affairs) and assistant vice-president (business operations). The collection has since expanded to include other sources such as artwork, oral histories and audio-visual recordings of special events. Much of the material received from the Stong Historical Society concerns the history of the land and community on which the main campus of the university is located in Toronto (formerly North York) Ontario. The original community, Kaiserville (later Elia), established circa 1800, was home to German loyalist settlers who had left Pennsylvania following the American Revolutionary War. The first settler in the area was Peter Erlin Kaiser who is buried on what is now the grounds of York University. When the University purchased its Keele Street land, there were extant buildings on the site. Among these, the principal buildings were the Jacob Stong house and the Abraham Hoover house. The Stong house was built on a parcel of land sold to Jacob by his father Daniel (d. 1868) and was constructed in the 1850s. Descendants of Jacob Stong sold the house in 1951. The Stong lands now form the central part of Black Creek Pioneer Village as well as forming the northern portion of the University property. The Hoover residence, built on a plot purchased by Christian Hoover in 1826, was constructed in 1848 by Christian and his son Abraham (1821-1905). The land (buildings and farm) was held by the Hoover family until the 1930s when it was purchased by a Mrs. Hart. In 1958 the house was purchased by Claude Passy, who resided in it for a period of time before selling it to York University ca. 1964. The Stong Historical Society was established in 1979 at Stong College, York University. Its purpose was to discover the history of the area on which the university was built, and it proposed that the houses of the Stong College residence bear the names of the pioneer families of the area. The society was begun by Olga Cirak, the college's administrative assistant. It is currently inactive. The collection consists of correspondence, photographs, genealogical charts, family histories, newspaper clippings, publications and related material detailing the history of the site on which the Keele Street campus of York University now stands; correspondence and newspaper clippings relating to the search for the grave site of Peter Erlin Kaiser and a photocopy of his Last Will and Testament; a genealogy and a history of the Kaiser family of Ontario (1933); copies of articles on the Palatine settlements in York County and Upper Canada; a publication, 'An account of the Boynton family and the family seat of Burton Agnes,' (1914); material on the Smith family (Hoover relations), correspondence seeking information from descendants of the Hoover family with responses, Hoover genealogies and material on the Troyer family genealogy (Hoover descendants); biographical material on York pioneers, correspondence, archaeological reports, copies of campus and survey maps and of architectural renderings of the Hart, Hoover, and Stong buildings on the University campus; obituary notices for the last surviving member of the Stong family who lived on the property, a copy of a genealogy of the family and a photocopy of a history of the church that was located on the property (by T.E. Kaiser);a newspaper article concerning Hart House, a building on the York campus which was relocated there in the 1930s from King Township, material related to the 40th anniversary celebrations of York University in 1999 and the York University Faculty Association strike of 1997, as well as other material details of which are available in the finding aid.
